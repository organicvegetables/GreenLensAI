SYSTEM ALGORITHM OVERVIEW

1. Core Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Framework: TensorFlow/Keras
Model Format: H5 (HDF5) format trained model
Input: 224×224 RGB images
Output: Binary classification (Organic vs. Inorganic)

2. Model Pipeline:
Frontend (app.js):

Uses TensorFlow.js with WebGL backend (CPU fallback)
Captures images from camera or file upload
Sends base64-encoded images to server
Backend (server.py - Flask):

Receives base64 image data
Preprocesses image:
Resizes to 224×224 pixels
Normalizes pixel values (0-1 scale)
Handles different image formats (Grayscale → RGB, RGBA → RGB)
Runs inference on the trained Keras model
Returns two confidence scores:
Organic Score (0-100%)
Inorganic Score (0-100%)

3. Classification Logic:
The system classifies vegetables as either:

Organic - naturally grown without synthetic pesticides/fertilizers
Inorganic - conventional farming with chemical inputs
Confidence levels determine detail level:

≥90%: Excellent/strong indicators
75-89%: Good/significant indicators
60-74%: Moderate indicators
<60%: Weak/uncertain signals
4. Detection Features:

Detects 2 vegetables: Cabbage and Lettuce
Real-time camera stream processing
Image upload capability
Generates detailed comments based on confidence scores

5. Deployment Architecture:
Model Conversion: convert_model.py converts H5 to TensorFlow SavedModel → TensorFlow.js compatible format
Server: Flask running inference backend
Client: HTML5/JavaScript web interface with camera API
The system is essentially a binary image classifier using deep learning to distinguish organic from inorganic produce based on visual characteristics.
